// names the codes and the columns, and we carry out exactly that instruction and
// then show its effect.
//
// The reporting is not decoration. The MATLAB script this was modelled on
// verified a recode by correlating the original score against the rebuilt one on
// the rows the recode did not touch, expecting ~1.00 — and got 0.9365, which
// revealed the item set was wrong rather than the recode. A change to data
// should have to show its work.
